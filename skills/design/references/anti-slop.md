# anti-slop.md — taste anchors and ban-lists

Depth for the SKILL.md §4 charter. Restraint anchored on production exemplars is the antidote to both flavors of slop.

## 1. Slop tells catalogue

Catalogue informed by Adrian Krebs (500 Show HN sites surveyed Mar 2025), Sailop's Top-10k AI-built sites scan, and ongoing SiteCritic anti-pattern threads.

### Purple-blue gradient

RLHF over-aligns to this; betrays self-generated palette.
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6366f1, #8b5cf6); /* slop */
```
Counter: pick ONE custom OKLCH accent from the direction's palette, no gradient.

### Inter alone as the type system

Default of every Vercel template; no commitment, no contrast.
```css
font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; /* slop */
```
Counter: pair a display family with a separate text family, both committed in the direction artifact.

### Centered hero plus 3-column feature grid

The shadcn landing-page silhouette; reads as preset before the eye finishes scanning.
```css
.hero { text-align: center; max-width: 64rem; margin-inline: auto; }
.features { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); } /* slop */
```
Counter: asymmetric grid with one optical-alignment override; left-aligned hero against a 3-column rhythm.

### Glassmorphism on every surface

Translucence loses meaning when nothing behind it is opaque.
```css
.card { backdrop-filter: blur(16px); background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); } /* slop when global */
```
Counter: glass once, on the surface that earns elevation; everything else opaque.

### `rounded-lg` uniform on every element

Radius without hierarchy is decoration, not signal.
```css
.button, .card, .modal, .input { border-radius: 0.5rem; } /* slop */
```
Counter: tier radius by element role — input 4px, card 8px, modal 16px — and commit the tiers.

### `shadow-md` uniform across the surface

Elevation that conveys nothing about z-order.
```css
.card, .dropdown, .toast { box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1); } /* slop */
```
Counter: pick three elevation tiers, named tokens, each tied to a stacking role.

### `transition: all`

Animates layout, color, and transform together; jank guaranteed.
```css
.button { transition: all 200ms ease; } /* slop */
```
Counter: name the properties — `transition: opacity 120ms ease, transform 120ms ease`.

### `font-family: system-ui`

Abdicates the type decision; reads as "did not pick".
```css
body { font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif; } /* slop */
```
Counter: commit a webfont stack derived from the direction's taste anchor.

### Default Tailwind palette

The costume of "I used the framework defaults".
```css
.cta { background: theme('colors.blue.500'); color: theme('colors.slate.50'); } /* slop */
```
Counter: derive 4-6 OKLCH swatches from a chosen accent; never reach for `slate-500` or `blue-500`.

### Colored card borders to assert structure

Borders are not the right tool for hierarchy; whitespace is.
```css
.card { border: 1px solid hsl(220 40% 90%); border-left: 4px solid blue; } /* slop */
```
Counter: remove the border, increase the gap; let negative space carry grouping.

### Emoji icons in production UI

Accessibility hostile; locale-fragile; reads as draft.
```html
<button>🚀 Deploy</button> <!-- slop -->
```
Counter: ship a real icon font or SVG sprite (Lucide, Phosphor, Radix Icons).

## 2. Overkill compensation catalogue

Slop in a different flavor — overkill is what happens when the model thinks "less" looks AI and overcorrects to "more".

### Sprites overdose

Decorative SVG sprites filling every empty pixel substituting for missing information density.
```css
.section::before { content: url('sparkle.svg'); }
.section::after { content: url('star.svg'); }
```
Counter: one decorative element per surface, defended; raise text density before adding ornament.

### Gradient on every section

Every section "important" means none are; the eye finds no entry point.
```css
section:nth-child(1) { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fef, #eef); }
section:nth-child(2) { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #efe, #fee); }
```
Counter: one accent gradient on the surface that earns it; the rest hold flat ground.

### Animation on every element

Motion budget is a budget; spend it once.
```css
* { animation: fadeInUp 600ms ease both; } /* slop */
```
Counter: animate only the focused element on entry; budget total motion in milliseconds and commit.

### Multi-paradigm mash

Neo-brutalism shadow on a glass card on a Material 3 button reads as confusion, not eclecticism.
```css
.card { backdrop-filter: blur(12px); box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 black; border-radius: 28px; } /* three paradigms */
```
Counter: pick one paradigm in the direction commit; defend the choice in the rationale line.

### Decorative noise compensating for a thin idea

When a surface earns its weight, restraint amplifies it; when it does not, decoration cannot rescue it.
```css
.hero::before { background: url('noise.png'); opacity: 0.4; } /* mask for missing proposition */
```
Counter: cut decoration; sharpen the headline; ship the surface or kill it.

## 3. Counter-techniques

1. **Explicit negative prompting with second-order forbids.** Banning Inter alone is not enough; the likely fallback must also be banned, or the model trades one slop tell for another.

   | If banned | Also ban (likely fallback) |
   |---|---|
   | Inter | Space Grotesk, Geist, Manrope |
   | Purple-blue gradient | Pink-orange, teal-cyan gradient |
   | `slate-500` | `zinc-500`, `gray-500`, `neutral-500` |
   | `rounded-lg` uniform | `rounded-xl` uniform, `rounded-2xl` uniform |
   | Glassmorphism global | Neumorphism global, mesh-gradient global |

2. **Style anchoring on production exemplars.** Every direction names 1-2 taste anchors from §4 below; vague references ("clean", "modern") underspecify and the model defaults to slop.
3. **Density commitment (2-3x default LLM output).** Vertical rhythm, line-height, and information density tighten 2-3x relative to the model's default. Default LLM output is sparse and air-padded; the sparseness itself reads as slop.
4. **Asymmetric grid (one optical-alignment override per page).** A single deliberate asymmetry — a hero left-aligned where the rest is centered, a sidebar that breaks the column rhythm — prevents the surface from reading as preset.
5. **OKLCH custom palette derivation.** Never the default Tailwind / Material ramp. Derive 4-6 swatches from a chosen accent in OKLCH space, with named lightness steps that match the direction's mood. Lightness ramps in OKLCH are perceptually uniform; HSL ramps are not.
6. **Code-level constraints.** Surface the bans in CSS via property-level lints (`stylelint-no-restricted-syntax`) or DTCG token validators. If a banned value enters tokens, every component inherits the slop.

## 4. Taste anchors with extracted tokens

Twelve exemplars. OKLCH values use `oklch(L C H)` triples where authoritatively observable; unverified positions marked `?` rather than fabricated.

| Stripe | `?` | `?` | Tiempos | Sohne | `?` | 8px | Editorial type accent on transactional UI | https://stripe.com |
| Vercel | `oklch(0 0 0)` | `oklch(1 0 0)` | Geist Sans | Geist Sans | Geist Mono | 4px | Monochrome with razor-edge mono accents | https://vercel.com |

| gh CLI | `?` | `?` | n/a (TUI) | n/a (TUI) | terminal mono | n/a | ANSI-degradation-aware status (green/red/yellow) | https://cli.github.com |
| Radix Colors | `?` | `?` | n/a (system) | n/a (system) | n/a | n/a | 12-step P3-aware ramps (1=app bg, 9=solid, 12=high-contrast text) | https://www.radix-ui.com/colors |
| Fluent 2 | `?` | `?` | Segoe UI Variable | Segoe UI Variable | Cascadia Code | 4px | Luminosity-aware shadows honest with backplate | https://fluent2.microsoft.design |

These are not templates. They are evidence. Read each as "why does this surface feel this way?" and the answer becomes the direction the next design must commit to.
