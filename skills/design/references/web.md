# web.md — vanilla CSS 2026 baseline

Surface reference for HTML and vanilla CSS. Companion to `references/anti-slop.md` for slop tells specific to web (uniform `rounded-lg`, `transition: all`, default Tailwind ramp, etc.).

> **Snapshot date: April 2026.** Every Baseline status below is a snapshot, not a guarantee. Re-verify on https://web.dev/baseline and https://developer.mozilla.org **before** relying on any feature in production code. Forward-dated "Widely Available" entries (e.g., "Widely Available Sep 2026") are projections — treat them as Newly Available until that date passes and you have confirmed status independently. Browser-conservative environments (enterprise IT, government, embedded) need an extra confirmation pass even on Widely Available features.

## 1. Posture

Vanilla CSS 2026 carries surfaces React used to need a framework for. Container queries, `:has()`, nesting, `color-mix()`, OKLCH, `popover`, View Transitions, and (as of March 15 2026) subgrid are all Widely Available or Newly Available in Baseline — the gap that made build-tooling indispensable around 2020 has closed.

Reach for vanilla first; React only when state crosses surface boundaries (see `references/react.md` §1). Pulling in React for what `:has()` and `@container` already do is ceremony, and ceremony is the first slop tell on `references/anti-slop.md`.

## 2. Baseline-2026 features

Each feature lists Baseline status, one concrete example, and the anti-pattern restraint exists to prevent. Two tiers separate ship-it-now from gate-or-verify.

## 2A. Use by default

Widely Available as of the April 2026 snapshot — no feature query needed in evergreen-browser projects. Re-verify on web.dev/baseline before adopting in browser-conservative environments.

### Container queries (`@container`)

Baseline Newly Available Feb 2023, Widely Available Feb 2025.
```css
.card { container-type: inline-size; }
@container (inline-size > 32rem) {
  .card__body { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 12rem 1fr; }
}
```
Anti-pattern: viewport media queries on component-scoped layout — the component cannot be reused inside a sidebar without rewriting the breakpoints.

### `:has()` selector

Baseline Newly Available Dec 2023, Widely Available Dec 2025.
```css
.card:has(:focus-visible) { outline: 2px solid var(--color-accent); }
.form:has(input:invalid) .submit { opacity: 0.5; }
```
Anti-pattern: a JS handler that toggles a `.is-invalid` class on the parent. `:has()` makes parent-state styling declarative; half a dozen handlers collapse to one selector.

### CSS nesting

Baseline Newly Available Aug 2023, Widely Available Aug 2025.
```css
.card {
  padding: var(--space-16);
  & > .card__title { font-size: var(--type-title); }
  &:hover { background: color-mix(in oklch, var(--bg) 92%, var(--accent)); }
}
```
Anti-pattern: SCSS or Less for nesting alone. The build step earns nothing once the platform ships nesting.

### `color-mix()`

Baseline Newly Available May 2023, Widely Available May 2025.
```css
--color-hover: color-mix(in oklch, var(--color-accent) 88%, var(--color-bg));
--color-disabled: color-mix(in oklch, var(--color-fg) 40%, transparent);
```
Anti-pattern: hand-rolled hex variants for hover, disabled, pressed. Mix in OKLCH and the perceptual lightness stays consistent across hues.

### OKLCH / Lab / LCh color

Baseline Newly Available May 2023, Widely Available May 2025.
```css
--color-accent: oklch(0.62 0.18 256);
--color-accent-strong: oklch(0.52 0.18 256);
```
Anti-pattern: HSL for design tokens. HSL lightness is not perceptual — `hsl(60, 100%, 50%)` and `hsl(240, 100%, 50%)` differ by ~70 in perceptual lightness despite identical L. OKLCH is the only modern token-color choice.

### CSS subgrid

Baseline Newly Available Sep 2023; Widely Available March 15 2026.
```css
.grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; }
.grid > .row { display: grid; grid-template-columns: subgrid; }
```
Anti-pattern: passing the parent's column track sizes through CSS variables to grandchild grids. Subgrid preserves alignment without the variable plumbing.

### View Transitions (same-document)

Baseline Newly Available Oct 2025.
```css
::view-transition-old(root), ::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-duration: 200ms;
  animation-timing-function: ease;
}
```
```js
document.startViewTransition(() => updateDOM());
```
Anti-pattern: Framer Motion or similar imported solely for cross-fade transitions. Same-document transitions are now native.

## 2B. Gate or verify first

Newly Available with a forward-dated Widely Available milestone, or Chromium-only at snapshot time. Use `@supports` or progressive enhancement; re-check status before removing the gate.

### `popover` attribute and `<dialog>`

Baseline Newly Available Apr 2024, Widely Available Apr 2026 — verify against current Baseline before dropping the fallback.
```html
<button popovertarget="menu">Open</button>
<div id="menu" popover>...</div>
```
Anti-pattern: a `position: fixed` div with `z-index: 9999` and a JS click-outside handler. The platform now does top-layer, focus return, and escape-to-close without a library.

### `text-wrap: balance`

Baseline Newly Available Sep 2024, Widely Available Sep 2026 — Newly Available at snapshot time; Safari and older Firefox still need verification.
```css
h1, h2, .lede { text-wrap: balance; }
```
Anti-pattern: manual `<br>` tags in headlines for visual balance. Browsers balance up to ~6 lines automatically; manual breaks fight the engine.

### Anchor positioning

Baseline Newly Available post-Jan 2026 — Firefox 147 default-enabled it. Gate behind `@supports (anchor-name: --x)`; the dependency footprint of fallback libraries is what this feature is meant to eliminate, so swapping the gate for Floating UI on missing support defeats the purpose.
```css
.tooltip { position: absolute; position-anchor: --button; top: anchor(bottom); }
```
Anti-pattern: Floating UI or Popper for simple tooltips when the platform supports anchor positioning. Keep the dependency only as a feature-query fallback.

### Scroll-driven animations

Chromium-stable; Safari Tech Preview / Firefox flag-only as of Apr 2026 — NOT Baseline. Use behind a feature query and supply a fallback.
```css
@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {
  .progress { animation: grow linear; animation-timeline: scroll(root); }
}
```
Anti-pattern: a `scroll` listener with `requestAnimationFrame`. Where the platform ships it, the listener is dead weight; where it does not, the listener is what to fall back to — but gate explicitly.

## 3. Token shape

Vanilla custom properties under `:root`. One concrete example:
```css
:root {
  /* Color — OKLCH only. No HSL, no hex, no RGB in tokens. */
  --color-bg-default:    oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-text-default:  oklch(0.18 0 0);
  --color-text-muted:    oklch(0.52 0 0);
  --color-accent:        oklch(0.62 0.18 256);
  --color-border:        oklch(0.92 0 0);

  /* Space — committed subset of 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64. */
  --space-4: 0.25rem; --space-8: 0.5rem; --space-16: 1rem;
  --space-24: 1.5rem; --space-32: 2rem;

  /* Type — at most two families. */
  --font-display: 'Geist Sans', sans-serif;
  --font-text:    'Geist Sans Text', sans-serif;

  /* Motion — named properties, single easing curve. */
  --motion-fast:   120ms;
  --motion-normal: 200ms;
  --ease-out:      cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);

  /* Radius — tiered scale, not uniform. */
  --radius-input: 4px; --radius-card: 8px; --radius-modal: 16px;

  /* Shadow — luminosity-aware if elevation matters. */
  --shadow-1: 0 1px 2px oklch(0 0 0 / 0.06);
  --shadow-2: 0 4px 12px oklch(0 0 0 / 0.10);
}
```

## 4. Layout patterns

**Container queries over breakpoints.** Component CSS sizes itself by container, not viewport. A card placed in a 280px sidebar collapses to single-column without the parent caring; placed in a 960px main column it expands. Reusability follows.

**Subgrid for nested grids.** Subgrid is Widely Available as of March 15 2026 — preserves alignment of grandchild grids against the root column tracks without re-declaring template columns. Use whenever a grandchild's columns must align to the grandparent's.

**`:has()` for parent-state styling.** `.card:has(:focus-visible)`, `.form:has(:invalid)`, `.row:has([aria-current])` — declarative parent reactions that previously required JS state mirroring. Fewer event handlers, fewer race conditions, fewer tests.

**`text-wrap: balance` for headlines.** Automatic visual balance on text blocks of ≤6 lines. Apply globally to `h1`, `h2`, and `.lede`-class blockquotes; do not apply to body paragraphs (browsers cap balanced blocks for performance and the cost on a long article is real).

**`color-mix()` for state variants.** Hover, pressed, disabled, focus-ring tints all compose from the base accent via `color-mix(in oklch, ...)`. The token surface stays small; the variants stay perceptually consistent.

## 5. Forbidden in tokens

- **HSL or RGB for design-token color.** OKLCH-only. HSL lightness is not perceptual and produces uneven ramps across hues.
- **JS scroll listeners for parallax or progress.** Use `animation-timeline: scroll()` where supported, `IntersectionObserver` otherwise. A `scroll` event handler running every frame is a battery and jank tax.
- **Layout-driven media queries on component-scoped content.** Container queries are the right axis once a component can appear in multiple containers.
- **`transition: all`.** Already banned in SKILL.md §4 charter. Restated here because it is the single most common slop tell on web — animates layout, color, and transform together; jank and unintended re-layouts guaranteed. Name the properties.
- **`*-system-ui` font stacks as the type system.** Already banned. A direction with no committed family is no direction; system-ui delegates the type pair to whatever the OS shipped.
- **Default Tailwind `gray-50…900` ramp imported wholesale.** RLHF and template defaults converge on it; the surface reads as preset before the eye finishes scanning.
- **Hardcoded hex or px values in component CSS.** Tokens precede components; components reference tokens. A `git grep '#[0-9a-f]\{3,8\}'` against component files should be empty.
